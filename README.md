# blogger_proj2
This project was never actually finished because of several problems during it creation but i do plan to come back and finish it eventually.

This is a blogging app designed for people to come and post and review eachothers posts about assorted animals. you can categorize your blog searches by animal and you can even log in and create a profile and view others profile and like what they had to say about a specific animal. 

this was a simple application that used boostrap as the major framework during creation and was created mostly HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
